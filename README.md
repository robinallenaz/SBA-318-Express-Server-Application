# Project Checklist

## Requirements
- [ ] Create and use at least two pieces of custom middleware.
- [ ] Create and use error-handling middleware.
- [ ] Use at least three different data categories (e.g., users, posts, or comments).
- [ ] Utilize reasonable data structuring practices.
- [ ] Create GET routes for all data that should be exposed to the client.
- [ ] Create POST routes for data, as appropriate. At least one data category should allow for client creation via a POST request.
- [ ] Create PATCH or PUT routes for data, as appropriate. At least one data category should allow for client manipulation via a PATCH or PUT request.
- [ ] Create DELETE routes for data, as appropriate. At least one data category should allow for client deletion via a DELETE request.
- [ ] Include query parameters for data filtering, where appropriate. At least one data category should allow for additional filtering through the use of query parameters.  
  _Note: DO NOT use API keys; this makes it more difficult for instructors to grade finished projects efficiently._
- [ ] Utilize route parameters, where appropriate.
- [ ] Adhere to the guiding principles of REST.
- [ ] Create and render at least one view using a view template and template engine.
  _This can be a custom template engine or a third-party engine. If you are stuck on how to approach this, think about ways you could render the current state of your API's data for easy viewing._
- [ ] Use simple CSS to style the rendered views.  
  _Note: This is not a test of design; it is a test of serving static files using Express. The CSS can be very simple._
- [ ] Include a form within a rendered view that allows for interaction with your RESTful API.
